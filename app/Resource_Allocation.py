    ### Optimal Police Resource Allocation
    
    The police resources have been allocated based on the following principles:
    
    1. **Prioritizing High-Risk Areas**: The beats with the highest crime severity, as determined by a weighted metric accounting for the number and severity of past crimes, have been allocated more police personnel.
    
    2. **Balancing Resource Distribution**: The allocation of ASI, CHC, and CPC officers has been carefully balanced based on the unique strengths and responsibilities of each role, ensuring a comprehensive and coordinated response.
    
    The table below shows the optimized distribution of police resources across the different beats within the {unit_name} area.
